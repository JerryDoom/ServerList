ServerList
==========

Show list view from IBM Blue Mix server

In this example I have 2 text fields on android screen, an add button and a list view.

When the add button is clicked the data there is saved into BlueMix server and then showed into the list view.

When I open the app the screed is refreshed and it shows the itesm from the server, so all the data is persist.

Any correction, question please to gerardogh@live.com
